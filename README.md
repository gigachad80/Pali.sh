#### Pali.sh : One-Click installation of Parrot Sec tools to any Arch or Debian distro

### 📌 Overview


 *_Pali.sh_* is a minimal shell script which installs all the Parrot Sec OS Pentesting tools in Kali ( NOTE : It only install those tools which are not available in Kali )

### 🤔 Why This Name?

Initially, it was meant only for Parrot and Kali. Later, I decided to support all distros, but I couldn't come up with a better name—so I stuck with the original idea: PA(rrot) + (Ka)LI = PALI.
